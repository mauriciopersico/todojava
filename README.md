# todojava
Sample of todo item application in java. You can create, edit and delete todo tasks. You have to login first.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
The following technologies were used to develop this application: 

* Java 7
* Maven 3
* Toncat 7
* Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers

## Running Locally

Make sure you have Java and Maven installed.  Also, install the [MySQL](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/).

    $ git clone https://github.com/mauriciopersico/todojava.git
    $ cd todojava
    $ mvn install

You have generated a spring-hibernate-template.war file in the *target* folder that it is in *todojava* root folder project.

Before starting your server, you have to run createtables.sql file (it is inside sql folder) on MySQL.  

Copy the spring-hibernate-template.war from target folder to the location you deploy web applications in Tomcat (default folder is "$CATALINA_BASE/webapps"). 
Start tomcat server on windos:

    %CATALINA_HOME%\bin\startup

Or start tomcat server on linux:

    $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh

If tomcat host is set to the default value you can access to the url [http://localhost:8080/spring-hibernate-template/](http://localhost:8080/spring-hibernate-template/) to test de app.

There is only one user available to login. The username is **admin@admin.com** and the password is **admin**.
